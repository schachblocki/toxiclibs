# Moved to toxiclibs.org: Important update 2010-03-15 #

## This repository is not in use anymore (archive only), please read below! ##
The entire project repository has recently been moved over to bitbucket.org, so please do update your bookmarks and get all your files from this new link below.

The latest release(s) are available from: http://hg.postspectacular.com/toxiclibs/

If you're one of these people who worked with the SVN version of this project, you'll have to know that the new revision control system used is Mercurial (hg) and you might have to install it first on your machine (it's easy!).

Hg has been chosen because it's much better adapted to my way of working and also will make it **much** easier to integrate patches contributed by other people.

Some guiding links for switching are also listed below.
